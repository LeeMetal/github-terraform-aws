  First was crated a public repository in the github. I created
a folder(infra) into the project to store (terraform) scripts.
  Now a created the files(main.tf, variables.tf, provider.tf
, backend.tf) and the environment folders with it's files.

  Configura aws account to connect with github actions clicking
(IAM -> Identity providers -> Add provider)
  1-in (Provider type) select (OpenIDConnect)
  2-in (Provider URL) use the url
    (https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com) you can find
    this url in the aws documentation.
  3-audience use (sts.amazon.com)
and click in (Add provider) now you can see tha table with the
created provider now click in the provider link to get in it and
click in the button (Assign role) select (Create a new role) and
(Next), in the field (Trusted entity type) select (web Identity)
, audience click and select the option (sts.amazon.com) now to 
set (Github organization) you need to get your github url 
in my case it was
(https://github.com/LeeMetal/github-terraform-aws)
and extract only(LeeMetal) to set in that field and if you want
to increase secrurity you can fill in the fields (Github 
repository and Github branch) now click in (Next). Now in the
search bar (Permissions policies) type (s3) and select
(AmazonS3FullAccess) and in my case i added to dynamodb typing
(dynamodb) in the search bar and selecting 
(AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess) now click in (Next) and name this
role i named(role-github-terraform-aws) and click in (Create
role).

  Create manually the bucket to store the statefiles,
click in (Create bucket) and i named it as
(github-terraform-aws-bucket-test) and to maintain the versioning
of the statefiles select (Enable) in the field (Bucket 
Versioning) and click in (Create bucket).

  the step bellow need creat only one time in one account to be 
used for all pipelines in the same account.
  Create a table in Dynamodb to lock changes concurrentes, get
in dynamodb and click in left menu (Tables) and click in 
(Create table) i named this table as (github-terraform-aws-lock)
  1-in (Partition key) need be (LockID) cause dynamodb will 
search for it, now click in create table.

  Now I'm back to the project and created a folder called 
(.github) into this folder a created (workflows) and into this
folder create a file (terraform.yml)
